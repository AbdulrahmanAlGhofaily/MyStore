# MyStore Project

This project is part of Udacity JavaScript Fullstack course. <br>
The goal is to build a store front using Angular.

## Getting started

Setting up this project is easy.<br>
In the project root run `npm install` then `ng serve` which will serve the website into your local machine browser. make sure to run it on the port 4200. If you want to change the port number, make sure to update the `product.service.ts` file by changing the url in the `getProducts()` function [`http://localhost:[specified port]/assets/data.json`].
